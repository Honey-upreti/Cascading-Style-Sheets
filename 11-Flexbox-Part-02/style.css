  /* box-sizing: border-box; is a CSS property that changes the way the width and height of an element are calculated. By default, the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content inside it, which can lead to unexpected results when padding and borders are added. When box-sizing: border-box; is applied, the width and height of an element include the content, padding, and border, making it easier to control the size of elements and create consistent layouts. This means that if you set an element's width to 200px and add 20px of padding and a 4px border, the total width of the element will still be 200px, rather than 224px (200px + 20px + 4px). */

/* difference between allign-items and justify-content:

- justify-content: controls the horizontal alignment of the children within the parent container. */

/* flex basis applies to both width and height properties depending on the flex direction, if it is row it applies to width, if it is column it applies to height. */

/* difference between flex basis and width/height:
- flex-basis: sets the initial size of a flex item before any available space is distributed. It can be set to a specific value (e.g., 100px) or to auto, which means the size will be based on the content of the item.
- width/height: sets the size of an element regardless of the flex container's available space. When used in a flex container, width and height can be overridden by the flex properties (flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis) depending on the available space in the container. */

/* in flex basis if the content is larger than the specified value, the flex item will grow to accommodate the content, but if the content is smaller than the specified value, there will be no shrinking because flex-basis sets the initial size of the flex item. */
